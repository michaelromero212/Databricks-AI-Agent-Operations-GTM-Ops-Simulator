# Databricks AI Agent Operations & GTM Ops Simulator

A production-style **AI Agent Operations & GTM Ops Simulator** demonstrating how AI agents are defined, governed, QA'd, monitored, and rolled out inside a sales-facing environment.

This project showcases **AI Operations, QA, governance, KPIs, dashboards, A/B testing, enablement, and GTM readiness** for a modern data and AI company.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This simulator demonstrates:

- **Business Intent & Governance** - How AI agent behavior is defined and constrained
- **AI Agent Operations** - Agent implementation using Hugging Face LLMs
- **QA & Validation** - Pre-deployment testing and validation workflows
- **KPIs & Analytics** - SQL-based metrics tracking and analysis
- **Dashboards** - Operational health monitoring (web + Jupyter)
- **A/B Testing** - Data-driven rollout decisions
- **Enablement** - User guidance and business reviews

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1. Create Virtual Environment

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd Databricks-AI-Agent-Operations-&-GTM-Ops-Simulator

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
# Windows:
# venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure Hugging Face Token (Optional)

The agent can use a free Hugging Face LLM. To enable this:

1. Get a free access token from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens)
2. Set the environment variable:

```bash
export HF_TOKEN="your_huggingface_token_here"
```

**Note:** The agent will use mock responses if `HF_TOKEN` is not set, allowing you to explore the system without an LLM.

### 4. Run the Web Application

```bash
cd webapp
uvicorn app:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Open your browser to: `http://localhost:8000`

### 5. Explore the Jupyter Dashboard

```bash
jupyter notebook dashboards/kpi_dashboard.ipynb
```
